  To whom it may concern:

  As per request, Princeton University hereby waives the rights that would otherwise flow to it pursuant to the policy
  on copyrights approved at its faculty meeting of September 19, 2011. This waiver applies to the following article:

  '<%= @waiver_info.title %>' in <%= @waiver_info.journal %>

  If the article specified above arose from NIH-funded research, please note that the University's waiver
  of its own copyrights in no way diminishes your obligations under the NIH Public Access Policy.
  You must accordingly take care that your contracts with publishers reserve rights sufficient to comply with the NIH
  policy.

  If you have any questions about the University copyright policy visit http://www.princeton.edu/dof/policies/publ/fac/open-access-policy.
  You are encouraged to contact the Office of the Dean of the Faculty at dof@princeton.edu.

  Sincerely,

  Jennifer Rexford
  Provost
